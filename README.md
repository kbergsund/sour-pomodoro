## Abstract
- sour pomodoro is a one-stop shop for some of the worst movies from the past couple of years. The homepage provides a quick view of each movie, with a star-rating visual above the poster. Choose to sort by a number of metrics to find the worst-rated, the oldest, or just alphabetically. Clicking any of the poster redirects you to a unique URL that provides additional data, from budget/revenue numbers, if available, to a numerical rating.

## Languages/Technology

- Clicking on a movie poster redirects users to a unique URL. Here they can see a backdrop image from the movie and additional data. Clicking the 'X' in the upper left takes them back to the homepage.

- If, at any point, a user tries to input their own invalid URL, they see an error page that gives them the option to go back to the homepage.

## Future Directions
1. Add a search bar to the homepage to search by title
2. Implement filtering by genre
3. Add more data
