## It's Definitely Not Rotten Tomatoes...

Turing School of Software & Design

2108 Front-End Engineering, Mod 3 - React Pair Project

## Abstract
sour pomodoro is a one-stop shop for some of the worst movies from the past couple of years. The homepage provides a quick view of each movie, with a star-rating visual above the poster. Choose to sort by a number of metrics: by rating, release year, or alphabetically. Clicking any of the poster redirects you to a unique URL that provides additional data, from budget/revenue numbers, if available, to a numerical rating. 

## Languages/Technology
React, React Router, Javascript, HTML, Sass, Cypress

## Learning Goals
Gain competency with React 
Create a multi-page UX using Router
Test React components & asynchronous JS using E2E testing

## Install & Setup
1. Clone this down
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`
5. Head to `localhost:3000` in your browser  

## Web App Attributes 
1. On load, users see a grid of movie posters. A corresponding star-rating visual is underneath. Posters scale slightly on hover.

2. In the upper right is a sort dropdown with a variety of sort options. The grid re-renders when a user makes their selection.

3. Clicking on a movie poster redirects users to a unique URL. Here they can see a backdrop image from the movie and additional data. Clicking the 'X' in the upper left takes them back to the homepage.

4. If, at any point, a user tries to input their own invalid URL, they see an error page that gives them the option to go back to the homepage.

5. There is also error handling in place for a 500-level internal server error.

## Future Directions
1. Add a search bar to the homepage (search by title)
2. Impliment filtering by genre
3. Add more data
